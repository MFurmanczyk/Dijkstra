# Dijsktra's algorithm
Implementation of Dijkstra's SP algorithm.

## Data structures and algorithms
- K-d tree - finds nearest vertex in a graph for start point and end point.
- Dijkstra's algorithm - finds shortest path in graph.
- Priority indexed queue - used in egde relaxation.
- Directed graph with weighted edges.

## Libraries
One of the goals of the project was to use the standard library in as many cases as possible. Visual side of this application is coded with [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

## Controlls
| Action | Button  |
| ------- | --- |
| Set start point | **LMB** |
| Set end point | **RMB** |
| Quit | **Esc** |
| Reset | **R** |

In order to find path user needs to:
1. Set start point.
2. Set end point.
3. If user wants to find another path Reset action is required.

## Literature
Literature and sites I used while coding this application:
- [Algorithms, 4th edition](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne
- [C++ documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
